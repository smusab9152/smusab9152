## Featured Projects

Explore some of my repositories to see my work in action:

- [LA Crime Prediction Project](https://github.com/smusab9152/LA_Crime) - This project looks at crime data from Los Angeles. It cleans and organizes the data, then explores patterns in different types of crimes and locations. Visualizations help show trends and insights clearly. The project also tries to predict future crime patterns. It’s a practical example of using data to understand city crime.
- [Pokemon Data Analysis](https://github.com/smusab9152/Pokemon_Data_Analysis) - This project looks at a dataset of different Pokémon and their attributes. It cleans the data and uses charts to explore patterns in stats like attack, defense, and speed. It also looks at trends across Pokémon types and generations. The project highlights differences between regular and legendary Pokémon. Overall, it helps understand the Pokémon data in an easy-to-see way.
- [Reddit Rules Classification](https://github.com/smusab9152/Reddit_rules_classification) - This project uses machine learning to determine whether Reddit comments follow subreddit rules. It processes the text of comments to predict if they comply with community guidelines. The goal is to help automate moderation by identifying rule-breaking content. This approach can assist in maintaining healthy online communities.
- [Beats Per Minute Prediction](https://github.com/smusab9152/bpm_pred_songs) -
